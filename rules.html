            For the specific game of Apple Chess
            <br/>
            , the rules state that the game begins with four disks placed in a square in the middle of the grid, two facing white side up, two pieces with the dark side up,with same-colored disks on a diagonal with each other. Convention has initial board position such that the disks with dark side up are to the north-east and south-west (from both players' perspectives),though this is only marginally meaningful to play (where opening memorization is an issue, some players may benefit from consistency on this). If the disks with dark side up are to the north-west and south-east, the board may be rotated by 90Â° clockwise or counterclockwise. The dark player moves first.
